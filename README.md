# Launchpad.Launchpad
A project to create a simple interface for the Novation Launchpad.Launchpad S using MIDI commands in Java. The Novation Launchpad.Launchpad S has a huge oppertunity for use as a simple grid based input device for a variety of applications, such as a simple games controller. The first goal of this project is to produce a simple interface with the Launchpad.Launchpad to enable simple development of other applications. The second goal is to produce a few technical demonstrations of the device in use. As a third and extended goal, it is intended to create an optional on screen interface for both testing without the physical device and monitoring applications as they run.
